## Project Description

An advanced application for depth estimation and 3D object reconstruction using the DPT model and 3D Point Cloud techniques. 
Utilized the Hugging Face Transformers library to predict depth from 2D images and generate detailed 3D meshes. 
Integrated Gradio for an interactive user interface, allowing users to upload images and visualize the resulting 3D models in real-time. 
This project uses computer vision, deep learning, and 3D graphics, into a complex but user-friendly applications with state-of-the-art technologies.
